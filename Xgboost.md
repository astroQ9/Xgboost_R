## What is Gradient Boosting Machine (GBM)?
### Gradient Boosting Machine (GBM) is one of the most popular forward learning ensemble methods in machine learning. 
### It is a powerful technique for building predictive models for regression and classification tasks.

## What is GBM model used for?
### A Gradient Boosting Machine or GBM combines the predictions from multiple decision trees to generate the final predictions. 
### All the weak learners in a gradient boosting machine are decision trees.
### A machine learning method called gradient boosting is used in regression and classification problems. 
### It provides a prediction model in the form of an ensemble of decision trees-like weak prediction models.

## What are the advantages of GBMs?
### High Accuracy: GBMs excel in terms of predictive accuracy, making them suitable for applications where precision is critical. 
### Handling Non-linearity: They can capture complex and non-linear relationships within data, making them versatile for various modeling tasks.
