## What is Gradient Boosting Machine (GBM)?
### Gradient Boosting Machine (GBM) is one of the most popular forward learning ensemble methods in machine learning. 
### It is a powerful technique for building predictive models for regression and classification tasks.

## What is GBM model used for?
### A Gradient Boosting Machine or GBM combines the predictions from multiple decision trees to generate the final predictions. 
### All the weak learners in a gradient boosting machine are decision trees.
### A machine learning method called gradient boosting is used in regression and classification problems. 
### It provides a prediction model in the form of an ensemble of decision trees-like weak prediction models.

## What are the advantages of GBMs?
### High Accuracy: GBMs excel in terms of predictive accuracy, making them suitable for applications where precision is critical. 
### Handling Non-linearity: They can capture complex and non-linear relationships within data, making them versatile for various modeling tasks.

## Why GBM is better than XGBoost?
### Light GBM is very fast when compared to XGBOOST and is a much better approach when dealing with large datasets. 
### This turns out to be a huge advantage when you are working on large datasets in limited time competitions.
### XGBoost is built to manage huge datasets very efficiently.

## What is DGC matrix?
### The dgCMatrix class is a class of sparse numeric matrices in the compressed, sparse, column-oriented format. 
### In this implementation the non-zero elements in the columns are sorted into increasing row order. 
### dgCMatrix is the “standard” class for sparse numeric matrices in the Matrix package.

## What is the difference between dgTMatrix and dgCMatrix?
### dgTMatrix : a general sparse matrix of doubles, in triplet representation. 
### dgCMatrix : a general sparse matrix of doubles, in CSC representation.
